## Upgrading and downgrading

### How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then copy over zeroone-qt.exe (on Windows) or /Applications/ZeroOne-Qt (on Mac) or zeroone/zeroone-qt (on Linux).

### Downgrade warning

Downgrade to a version < 0.12.3.4

Because release 0.12.3.4 is a mandatory upgrade release, downgrading to an earlier version is not supported.


## Notable changes

- Enforces Spork 8 as of block 159551 (approx. Nov. 24)
- All masternode owners and miners should upgrade as soon as possible
